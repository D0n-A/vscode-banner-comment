# Banner Comment

A Visual Studio Code extension that lets you quickly create neat banner comments from the selected text.
It is handy for visually separating code blocks, adding headings to configuration files, or simply leaving eye-catching comments.

## Features

- Converts the selected text into a styled banner.
- User-defined keyboard shortcut via standard VS Code settings.
- Extremely easy to use.

## How to Use

1. **Select text** — highlight the word or phrase you want to turn into a banner.
2. **Run the command**
    - **Command Palette:** press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), start typing “Create Banner Comment” and choose the command.
    - **Keyboard shortcut:** by default press `Ctrl+Alt+B` (Windows / Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+B` (macOS).

After execution the selected text is replaced with a banner like:

```
# ---- YOUR SELECTED TEXT ----
```

(The exact appearance depends on the configured width and padding character)

## Configuration

This extension provides the following settings that can be configured in your VS Code User or Workspace settings:

- `bannerComment.lineWidth`: The total width of the banner comment line.
  - Type: `integer`
  - Default: `80`
- `bannerComment.paddingCharacter`: The character used to pad the banner comment. Any character can be used, including Cyrillic letters.
  - Type: `string`
  - Default: `"-"`

Example `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "bannerComment.lineWidth": 100,
    "bannerComment.paddingCharacter": "*"
}
```

## Customizing Keybindings

You can customize the keybinding for the "Create banner comment" command to your preference.
By default, it is bound to `Ctrl+Alt+B` (or `Cmd+Alt+B` on macOS).

To change this:

1. Open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor:
    - Menu: `File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts` (`Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts` on macOS).
    - Command Palette: `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts`.
    - Shortcut: `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`.
2. In the search bar of the Keyboard Shortcuts editor, type `bannerComment.make` (which is the command ID) or "Create banner comment".
3. You will see the "Create banner comment" command. You can then click the pencil icon next to it to change its keybinding, or right-click and select "Change Keybinding...".
4. Enter your desired key combination and press Enter.

Alternatively, you can directly edit your `keybindings.json` file. You can open this file by running "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" from the Command Palette. Add an entry like this, replacing `"your.desired.keys"` with your chosen key combination:

```json
{
    "key": "your.desired.keys",
    "command": "bannerComment.make",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```
